## Overview
This project uses online retail data from UCI ML Repository. Used SQL and python to understand user purchasing behaviour. Basically, this Tableau graph tells us how many users have returned in the 1,2,3
.....13th months after they made their first purchase. This analysis gives us customer retention rate and also we can further get churn rate from this analysis.
